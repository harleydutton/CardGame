A screen where players input a few variables so the [[App]] can present them with encounters:
- Something to indicate whose turn it is (class icon in corner) to resolve an encounter
- Way to select additional players (scrollable ribbon of radio buttons with class icons) to participate in the encounter
- Large buttons with icons for each [[Encounter]] type leading to an encounter resolution screen
- A button to skip the selected turns
