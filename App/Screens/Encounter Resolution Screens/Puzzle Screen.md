riddles and word puzzles. Ideally funny ones. Could also be party game stuff like "get another player to say 'you're an ambulance' without using those words" or "get someone who hasn't seen this screen to give you a hug". perhaps minigames in later versions. should be timed either for quality of rewards or failure condition. maybe both.

I might need to include a generic screen that indicates the next screen is secret.

- Secret: Get someone to say "you're an ambulance" without using those words -> success/failure buttons. only for multiplayer
- Secret: Get someone to give you a hug -> success/failure buttons. Only for multiplayer
- "Speak friend and enter" but in another language -> friend in that language
- "What's brown and sticky?" -> "a stick"
