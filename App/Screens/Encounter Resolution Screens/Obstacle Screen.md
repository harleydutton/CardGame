Should describe an obstacle. If successfully resolved can be passed. Otherwise blocks movement.

not sure how this is going to work honestly. the cards don't currently give you a good way to do non-combat resolution

an option is to have it be similar to puzzles, quests, or require tool cards

it could be interesting to have obstacles appear only on dead ends such that resolving the encounter successfully removes the tile and knocks you back while failing the encounter just flips the tile to a blank dead end
