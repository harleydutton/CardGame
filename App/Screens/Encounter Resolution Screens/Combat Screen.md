- monsters - display each of these things in a little card for each monster
	- attack - numeric value of damage to do to targeted player (pretend initiative: do 0 damage half the time. add +1x damage if ambush [[Encounter]])
	- target - player the app decides that monster is targeting
	- armor - this monster's damage reduction
	- health - live ticker of health remaining
	- image - duh
	- narration/warcry - duh
- should have already determind which players are in this fight so just player cards
	- player widgets should have a way to input damage
	- player widgets should each have a "flee" button at the bottom
- app should have a "~fight for 1 round~" button (paraphrasing)

should players be allowed to target monsters or should the app do it for them?
