- will be square
- should be about 2x2 or 3x3 carboard/card stock
- should be about 50-100 of them
- will have traffic controls
	- red/stop = indicates you must stop moving here and deal with the stop
	- yellow/hazard = indicated blocked. you cannot explore new tiles from this tile until you deal with the hazard
	- green/no-symbol = no movement restrictions
- types
	- 90 deg turn hall
	- straight hall
	- T-junction
	- 4-way intersection
	- dead end

with 10 types of encounters and 5 types of tiles I would expect 50~ tiles
- obstacle encounters should not appear on dead end tiles to that frees up 1
- there should be a home tile. perhaps the 4way blank tile
- we might want to add a [[BBEG]] tile as a one-off to encourage players to go down stairs rather than explore the whole stack of tiles.

tiles should be in a big, shuffled, facedown stack or revealed and placed in valid locations to form the [[Map]]
