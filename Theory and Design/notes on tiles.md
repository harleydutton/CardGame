![[Tiles|Tile]]


---

- should be about 50-100. easy with encounter icon combinatorics. expansions can add more.
- will have traffic controls. might be baked into the encounter icons
	- red/stop = indicates you must stop moving here and deal with the stop
	- yellow/hazard = indicated blocked. you cannot explore new tiles from this tile until you deal with the hazard
- types
	- 90 deg turn hall
	- straight hall
	- T-junction
	- 4-way intersection
	- dead end
- rather than having an encounter consumed token, tiles could be double sided and flipped.
- obstacle encounters should not appear on dead end tiles to that frees up 1
- there should be a home tile. perhaps the 4way blank tile
- we might want to add a [[BBEG]] tile as a one-off to encourage players to go down stairs rather than explore the whole stack of tiles.
- there was talk of adding a boss encounter icon as a single tile.
