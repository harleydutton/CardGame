Parts of a class as currently imagined:
- a cardboard board with some amount of information
	- equipment slots
	- stats like health an movement
	- decent sized list of upgrades that can be bought with [[Resources]]
- [[Pawn|Pawn]]
- character icon in the [[App]]
- starter deck?


Class Ideas:
- rogue, has stealth, treats [[Combat.png]] and [[Ambush.png]] as non blocking/stopping per the traffic controls in [[Tiles|Tile]]
- wizard, has second sight, treats ambush and trap [[Encounter|Encounters]] as blocking rather than stopping per [[Tiles|Tile]] traffic controls.
