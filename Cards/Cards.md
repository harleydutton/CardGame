- at least some cards should be [[Trade|Tradeable]]. Assumes some are not
	- items/armor/weapons/tools/consumables seem tradeable
	- spells/abilities/powers/blessings/etc seem bound
	- bound and tradeable if we are looking for terms
	- bound/trade cards should be indicated on the face as **all cards should have the same back**
- should minimize number of decks in this game. one deck would be ideal.
- players can have a maximum of 5 cards in their hand
- all cards should have a move value, probably tied to [[Drop|Dropping]] the card.
- when players take damage they must [[Drop]] one card for each point of damage. players can choose to drop cards from a combination of their hand, [[Discard]], or top of [[Deck]].
- playing cards will [[Discard]] them
- players should shuffle their hand, [[Discard]] and [[Deck]] at [[Setup Phase]] before drawing a new hand.
- perhaps if you don't have enough cards in [[Deck]] to draw a full hand at the start of [[Movement Phase]] you [[Exhaust]]. not sure yet if players should discard remainder of hand but should definitely draw up to hand size regardless.
- revive scroll cards should probably exist
	- potentially let players keep their stuff when it would be lost
	- revive immediately or during [[Setup Phase]]?
	- should [[Exhaust]] cause players to lose their cards?
- **All cards have the implicit text of "[[Drop]] this card to [[Move]] your [[Pawn|Pawn]]"**
- ![[Non-equipment card format]]
- ![[New Cards]]- I'm not sure this should be it's own note rather than being treated like hand, discard, deck, and play.
