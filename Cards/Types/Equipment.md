come [[Cards]] will have a mode that let you play them in a semi-permanent fashion. they will grant you some bonus while they are equipped. there are equipment slots. equipment can be upgraded: equip a bow, then play other bows under the first one to level it up. all equipment is [[Discard|Discarded]] at [[Setup Phase]]/[[Exit]].

---

it feels like we are moving away from a resource system. as such equipment probably shouldn't have an equip cost. similarly, there shouldn't really be a cost beyond putting a matching card underneath your equipment to upgrade it. [[Upgrade]] should probably be a keyword.
Equipment should grant attack or defense.


## equipment should offer
- [[Offense]]
- [[Defense]]
- abilities in `cost:effect` format


----

# each of these should be a type. "equipment" is not a type
- Sword
- Bow
- Axe
- Hammer
- Spear
- Non-traditional weapons for spellcasting classes (book, orb, wand, staff as options if we don't like this path) as they should be using spells which they probably [[Play]] rather than [[Equip]]
- Potions
- Scrolls
- Armor (and maybe some subtypes)
- Shields
- Things like crossbows and throwing daggers could be consumables

----

break these out into types or even just card descriptions
