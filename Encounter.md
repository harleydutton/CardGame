Encounters will appear as icons on [[Tiles]] and during the encounter phase you should press the matching button in the [[App]] to resolve that encounter. Encounter consumed tokens must exist to place on tiles--ideally covering the encounter icon. Players should get what's on the tin 90% of the time and a twist (think mimic) the other 10%.
